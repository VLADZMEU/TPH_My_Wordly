# TPH_My_Wordly

Wordly is a simple word-guessing game where players must guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed letters and allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.

## How to Play

1. Click on the letters on the keyboard to input your guess.
2. Press "Enter" to check the entered word.
3. If a letter is correct and in the right position, it will be highlighted in green.
4. If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it will be highlighted in yellow.
5. If a letter is not in the word, it will be highlighted in gray.
6. Try to guess the word within six attempts!
